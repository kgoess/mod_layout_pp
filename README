NAME
    Apache2::Layout - mod_perl 2.0 html layout engine

SYNOPSIS
    httpd.conf:

      PerlModule Apache2::Layout

      Alias /layout /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
      <Location /layout>
        PerlOutputFilterHandler Apache2::Layout

        PerlSetVar LayoutFooter /footer.html
        PerlSetVar LayoutHeader /header.html
        PerlSetVar LayoutCSS /head.html
      </Location>

DESCRIPTION
    Apache2::Layout is a filter module that can be used to inject HTML
    layout into HTML documents. Very handy when trying to apply
    customizations to existing HTML content without needing to change them.

    Only documents with a content type of "text/html" are affected - all
    others are passed through unaltered.

    This is a pure-perl handler, the XS code was removed.

OPTIONS
    LayoutComments
        Inserts HTML comments in the output, marking where inserted content
        begins and ends

          PerlSetVar LayoutComments On

        LayoutComments has no default.

    LayoutDebug
        Logs debugging information about the processing. Combined with
        LayoutComments, will insert a debug summary as an HTML comment at
        the end of the filtered document.

          PerlSetVar LayoutDebug On

        LayoutDebug has no default.

    LayoutCSS
        Specifies a url to insert right before the end of the HTML <head>
        element, typically used to inject stylesheets into the document.

          PerlSetVar LayoutCSS /css/style.css

        LayoutCSS has no default.

    LayoutHeader
        Specifies a url to insert right after the beginning of the HTML
        <body> element, typically used to inject the begging of a content
        wrapper into the document.

          PerlSetVar LayoutHeader /templates/header.html

        LayoutHeader has no default.

    LayoutFooter
        Specifies a url to insert right before the end of the HTML <body>
        element, typically used to inject the end of a content wrapper into
        the document.

          PerlSetVar LayoutHeader /templates/footer.html

        LayoutFooter has no default.

    LayoutIgnoreURI
        Say you *don't* want to mangle foo.html and bar.html, but you do
        want to apply headers to everything else in the directory:

            PerlSetVar LayoutIgnoreURI /thisdir/foo.html
            PerlAddVar LayoutIgnoreURI /thisdir/bar*.html

        Note the difference between SetVar and AddVar. You can only have one
        Set, but as many Adds as you need.

        Wildcards are supported via Text::Glob.

API
  handler
    This is the one and only user-visible function, it's the main filter
    handler.

      PerlOutputFilterHandler Apache2::Layout

NOTES
    This is alpha software, and as such has not been tested on multiple
    platforms or environments.
